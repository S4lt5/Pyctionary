# Pyctionary
Multiplayer Pictionary client for Python.

This is a multi-user client for TK written for a Python Course at UIS. It uses TK canvas to repeatedly draw lines and small circles to allow the end user to draw with their mouse.

Multiple clients can connect to eachother and use a shared drawing space.

Done for a short in-class project. Video @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHasXen1Dnw
